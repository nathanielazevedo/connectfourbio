> Connect Four with a microbe twist. Choose your board size, microbes and agar type. Enjoy!


## General info
This game is based on Connect Four rules. Although, instead of chips, one must swab (using an innoculating loop) four microbe colonies in a row. If four of the same colonies are swabbed in a row, that microbe takes over the petri dish. First choose your petri dish size, then the agar type, the choose microbe one and microbe two. I have also created a computer opponite which allows for single player games.
